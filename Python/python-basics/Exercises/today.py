# In this exercise, you will write a simple Python script from scratch. The script will create a variable called today that stores the day of the week.
# In your editor create a new file and save it as today.py in the python-basics/Exercises folder.
# Create a variable called today that holds the current day of the week as literal text (i.e., in quotes).
# Use the print() function to output the variable value.
# Save your changes.
# Test your solution.

today = "Tuesday"
print(today)
